Blue And Sentimental 
My dreams are blue dreams,
Just won't come true dreams I find

Blue And Sentimental 
I can't forget you
My heart won't let you out of my mind
It rains all the time since you said good-bye
The skies and my eyes and my heart all cry

Blue And Sentimental 
if you don't want me
Why do you haunt me and keep me feeling
